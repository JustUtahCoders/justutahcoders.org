# Hello World

Welcome to JustUtahCoders! We are a non-profit dedicated to providing affordable and pro-bono software development to other local non-profits, increasing local tech education, and participating in causes such as justice reform in Utah. Yes, that's quite the list. But we are here to prove you can do a lot with a little as long as you work with forethought and conscious.

Let's breakdown how we're going to be doing all this.

## Affordable and Pro Bono Dev Services

There are many companies who offer their services cheap or free to non-profits, but the discount is only financial. These contracts often come with restrictions that you must use the company's proprietary software or must share the non-profit's client data with their company.

The other hidden cost is every non-profit is different, with different goals and different methods of operation. One-size fits all programs often don't fit their needs, but custom software is a high price investment in most cases. That price tag for custom software is usually just too far out of reach for a non-profit organization, or cuts into the funds that should be more directly helping their clients.

Our solution is to offer pro-bono and "low-bono" custom software development services. We fund these endeavors primarily through donation funds, grants, and volunteer labor.

Now why is this an important service to offer? Aside from providing a lower cost alternative that doesn't ask for client data that is. Keeping an organizations tech up to date and build to purpose keeps labor costs down. This raises the impact to cost ratio drastically. And not just financial cost. While making sure a non-profit organization's precious donations are not wasted, it is just as important to make sure their volunteers' time is not wasted. Volunteers need to feel like they are making a noticeable contribution to have the motivation to continue donating their time. Smoother workflow means lower volunteer turn over, which means less time spent on training. Saving resources lets these organizations do more with what they have.

## Increasing Education

The software industry is in a unique educational boom right now. Coding camps (good and bad) are cropping up all over the globe. The upside of this is faster, more affordable guided education is available to more people than ever to make the leap into the software industry. The downside is not every camp can get their students fully job ready in the brief time allotted, and they cannot provide the work experience needed to land a job out the gate. That's where our internship program comes in.

We are providing internships for new devs to both round out their education with active mentorship, and to provide real world on the job experience to move forward in their career.

In addition to the internships, we hope to provide educational content for all to help tackle the early stage learn curve of going from an entry level to a mid level dev.

## Local Causes

Our current local cause focus is centered around justice reform. We feel that legal consequences shouldn't set you up for further failure, and those working to improve their lives should have more access to doing so.

Utah legislation recently made a step in the right direction with updates to the expungement laws. These have made expungements more automated when possible, and should make them more accessible. Our goal in helping with this process is to spread the word about expungements even being an option to so many who have turned their life around or made a one off mistake. We are also working towards helping the legal ins and outs of trying for an expungement more clear cut on what you need to do and when.
